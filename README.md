## Brief summary of dataset contents, contextualized in experimental procedures and results.
This is the dataset used for the SEM analysis of the paper "Influential factors and barriers change along the invasion continuum of an alien plant" published in Biological Invasions (10.1007/s10530-023-03087-3)


## Description of the data and file structure
Please, find below the metadata of the file with the description of variables, scale, source, and transformation for analyses, if any.

- study_patch: name of the 108 study patches

- annual_mean_temp: annual mean temperature (ºC*10) in the centroid of the study patch standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation. Source: WorldClim (Fick and Hijmans, 2017)

- annual_precip: mean annual precipitation (mm) in the centroid of the study patch standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation. Source: WorldClim (Fick and Hijmans, 2017)

- patch_colour: colour (bicolour=1/only yellow=0) of the individuals of Cytisus scoparius in study patches. This variable was measured in the field

- patch_cover_100: cover (%) of Cytisus scoparius in an area of 100 m radius from the centroid of the study patch. This variable is log-transformed and standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation. Source: Cytisus scoparius cover map built exclusively for this project from aerial photos taken in the study area during C. scoparius bloom in 2010 

- patch_height: height (m) averaged from 10 randomly selected individuals of Cytisus scoparius per study patch. This variable was measured in the field and is standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation

- shrubland_cover_750: cover (%) of shrubland habitats (i.e., alto andino, matorral, estepa y pradera, pastizal húmedo, pastizal antropizado, lenga achaparrada and vacíos) in an area of 750 m radius from the centroid of the study patch. This variable is log-transformed and standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation. Source: Land cover Map of Nahuel Huapi N.P (Gowda et al, 2014) updated based on Google Earth 2011

- slope_750: mean slope (º) in an area of 750 m radius from the centroid of the study patch. This variable is logit-transformed and standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation. Source: Digital Elevation Model (http://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/gdem.asp)

- urban_cover_750: cover (%) of urban habitats in an area of 750 m radius from the centroid of the study patch. This variable is log-transformed and standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation. Source: Land cover Map of Nahuel Huapi N.P (Gowda et al, 2014) updated based on Google Earth 2011

- visitation_rate	overall proportion of Cytisus scoparius tripped flowers over the total number of open flowers counted in three randomly selected branches of ca. 30 cm of 10 randomly selected individuals of C. scoparius per study patch. This variable was measured in the field and is standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation

- water_shore_length_750	length (m) of river or lake shore in an area of 750 m radius from the centroid of the study patch standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation. Source: shapefile of Water streams (Instituto Geográfico Nacional de la República Argentina)
